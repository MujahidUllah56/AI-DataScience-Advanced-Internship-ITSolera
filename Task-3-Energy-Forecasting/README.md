# Task 3: Energy Consumption Forecasting

## 🎯 Objective
Forecast short-term household energy usage using time-series models.

## 📊 Dataset
Household Power Consumption Dataset

## ⚙ Approach
- Time-series parsing and resampling
- Feature engineering (hour, weekday)
- ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost comparison
- Evaluation using MAE and RMSE

## 📈 Results
- Prophet and XGBoost captured seasonal patterns better
- Accurate short-term predictions achieved

## 🏁 Conclusion
Time-series forecasting improves energy planning and load management.
